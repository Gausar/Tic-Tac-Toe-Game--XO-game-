# XO Game
# Tic Tac Toe Game

# About the Code
While implementing this game, I utilized the csapp.c code available at Carnegie Mellon University's website. This code is publicly accessible and can be used by anyone.

# About How to Play
If you are playing it on your computer locally, use localhost and port 8080.
You can compile the server code as follows:
        gcc server.c csapp.c -o server
        ./server 8080
For the client code:
        gcc client.c csapp.c -o client
        ./client localhost 8080
If you are playing with a friend, use each other's hostname and port.

# Additional Notes
You can further improve this code to handle scenarios where a player enters a position that has already been taken. Currently, the code does not prompt for another position in such cases.

Lastly I added new file which is written without thread. And I add in this invalid position problem solving.
